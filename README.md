## Presentation
<p>
Insect Tower is a tower defense game about the world of insects. The goal is to defend the Ant Queen against waves of invaders. To do this, as in reality, ants will call on other species of insects, which they will feed in exchange for their protection. Different resources can be used to increase the strength, rate of fire or range of insects.
</p>
<p>
This project is entirely developed in C, with OpenGL v2 graphics API. This is an initiative resulting from a lecture about image synthesis and algorithmics at IMAC engineering school.
</p>

Realized in May 2019.
